# Session Summary — March 9, 2026

## What Was Done

### Phase 3B–3D: Backend Unified Accounts Migration (completed prior sessions + early this session)
- Added `provider_account_id` FK to `EdgeDatabase`, `EdgeCache`, `EdgeQueue`, `Datasource` models
- Alembic migration `df956eaea66f` applied
- Added `test_connection` + `discover` handlers for turso, neon, postgres, mysql, wordpress_rest in `edge_providers.py`
- Extended Upstash discover for Redis + QStash
- Refactored all 3 CRUD files (`edge_databases.py`, `edge_caches.py`, `edge_queues.py`) to accept `provider_account_id`, serialize with `account_name`

### Phase 3E: Frontend Account-Linked Forms (this session)
- **Created** `AccountResourcePicker.tsx` — shared component: Select Account → Discover → Pick Resource → auto-fill form
  - Supports `resourceTypeFilter` (e.g. show only `redis` or only `qstash`)
  - Supports `createResourceType` with inline "Create New" form (name + region)
- **Created** backend `POST /api/edge-providers/discover-by-account/{account_id}` — decrypts stored creds server-side, calls discover
- **Created** backend `POST /api/edge-providers/create-resource-by-account/{account_id}` — creates resources via management API (Upstash Redis)
- **Integrated picker into**:
  - `EdgeDatabasesForm.tsx` — Neon accounts (Turso removed, see below)
  - `EdgeCacheDialog.tsx` — Upstash Redis (`resourceTypeFilter='redis'`, `createResourceType='redis'`)
  - `EdgeQueuesForm.tsx` — Upstash QStash (`resourceTypeFilter='qstash'`)
- **Updated** `useEdgeCacheForm.ts` with `formAccountId` state + payload
- **Added** 5 new provider types to `EdgeProvidersSection.tsx` (neon, postgres, mysql, wordpress_rest, + turso was added then removed)

### Bug Fixes (this session)
1. **Upstash "Create New Redis"** — fixed "regional db creation is deprecated" by using `primary_region` + `read_regions: []` (Global Redis)
2. **QStash discover** — Management API key ≠ QStash token. Wrapped in try/except (best-effort). If auth fails, gracefully returns only Redis resources
3. **Turso removed from Connected Accounts** — no dashboard API tokens page, no OAuth. Turso stays as per-DB manual entry (URL + auth token) in Edge DB form

## Current State of Files

### Backend (FastAPI)
| File | Status |
|---|---|
| `app/routers/edge_providers.py` | ✅ Discover + create-resource endpoints added |
| `app/routers/edge_databases.py` | ✅ `provider_account_id` in schemas/CRUD |
| `app/routers/edge_caches.py` | ✅ `provider_account_id` in schemas/CRUD |
| `app/routers/edge_queues.py` | ✅ `provider_account_id` in schemas/CRUD |
| `app/core/security.py` | ✅ Provider schemas updated |
| `app/models/edge.py` | ✅ FK columns added |

### Frontend (React)
| File | Status |
|---|---|
| `settings/shared/AccountResourcePicker.tsx` | ✅ NEW — shared picker component |
| `settings/shared/EdgeDatabasesForm.tsx` | ✅ Neon picker integrated |
| `settings/shared/EdgeCacheDialog.tsx` | ✅ Upstash Redis picker + Create New |
| `settings/shared/EdgeQueuesForm.tsx` | ✅ Upstash QStash picker |
| `settings/shared/EdgeProvidersSection.tsx` | ✅ neon/postgres/mysql/wordpress added, turso removed |
| `hooks/useEdgeCacheForm.ts` | ✅ `formAccountId` state added |

## What Still Needs To Be Done

### Immediate (test what was built)
- [ ] Test Upstash Cache → "Create New Redis Database" (fixed regional deprecation)
- [ ] Test QStash Queue → discover (may or may not show QStash depending on API key)
- [ ] Test Neon Edge DB → account picker → discover projects

### Remaining Migration Items
- [ ] Datasource form: account selector for postgres/mysql/wordpress/neon (in `Datasources.tsx`)
- [ ] Show `account_name` badge on DB/cache/queue list items in the UI
- [ ] `secrets_builder.py`: resolve tokens via FK when inline token is absent
- [ ] Data Sources (Postgres, MySQL, WordPress API, GraphQL, Neon) — need same unified pattern

### Known Bugs (from bugs.md, separate session)
- Deno Deploy: `APP_NOT_FOUND` error on deploy
- Upstash engine deploy (Upstash Workflows): 404
- Netlify engine deploy: subdomain uniqueness error
- Vercel: deployed but "No Production Deployment" on dashboard
- Supabase: deployed with failed request on dashboard

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Turso**: No Connected Account — connects per-DB (URL + auth token). Turso has no public OAuth and the dashboard API tokens page doesn't exist at the documented URL
2. **Upstash**: One Connected Account (email + management API key) serves both Redis (cache) and QStash (queue). QStash discovery is best-effort since the management API key may not work as QStash Bearer token
3. **All providers**: `provider_account_id` FK on edge infra resources links to `EdgeProviderAccount` table. Backend serialization includes `account_name` for display
4. **Create New resources**: Only Upstash Redis supported via management API. Uses Global Redis (not regional)
